# Professional README Generator

![screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

## Description

The goal of this application is to allow the user easily create their own README.md file professionally through the command-line application. By taking in the user's input, the command line application will generate a solid README file that looks clean and organized. Through this activity, I was able to learn how inquirer works and how to retrieve the data from the prompts.
