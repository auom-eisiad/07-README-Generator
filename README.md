# Professional README Generator

![screenshot](/images/screenshot.png)

## Description

The goal of this application is to allow the user easily create their own README.md file professionally through the command-line application. By taking in the user's input, the command line application will generate a solid README file that looks clean and organized. Through this activity, I was able to learn how inquirer works and how to retrieve the data from the prompts.

## Installation

All installations should already be installed but if there are missing packages, please do the following:

Install the inquirer:
```npm i inquirer@8.2.4```

Install the node modules:
```npm i```

## Usage

To run this application, you will need to go into your terminal and type in "node index.js" into the command line. You will then be prompted to answer some questions regarding what kind of information you would like to input into your README. Once you are done answering all the questions, the generator will create a new README.md file within the "Develop" folder. You will see that all your information should be in there. If you happen to answer "no" to any of the prompt, the application will automatically input "N/A" into that section.
